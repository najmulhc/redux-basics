redux is a javascript library to manage state;
it will helps to sync all states in the fronend. 
it can be called as database in frontend. makes data flow transparent. 
props:
make changes predicatble, centralized state, easy to debug, preserve page state;
const : 
complexity, verbose(you need to use boiler plate code)

is redux for me?
